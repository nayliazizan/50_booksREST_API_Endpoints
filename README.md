this is just exercise that i did when learning fullstack engineer at codecademy. therefore, the whole code wasnt mine. i only put a few lines to complete exercise

goal of this lesson is to learn how to create restful endpoints.

some notes briefly explain what code files are:
1. frontend/src/components/Book.js: for update and delete, render book component
2. frontend/src/components/Booklist.js: for read and create, render bookSchedule component
3. backend/routes/Books.js: for implement CRUD operations
